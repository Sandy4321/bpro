1. To run:

python bpro.py -h

2. To generate different profile data:

python bpro.py -g

but first:

2.1. go into the seed directory
2.2. open any file for instructions. Note: you will need to gather the seed content yourself for licensing reasons.
2.3. add as many files for a given genre while following the naming scheme started.
2.4. add or alter genres as needed, i.e. replace rave with deathmetal

3. To analyze

python bpro.py -a

If you do not generate your own profile data, the default ones shipped and discussed in the article will be analyzed.
